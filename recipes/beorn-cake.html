    <h1>Beorn's Honey Cake Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I'm super excited to present Geeky Chef's first submission post! This recipe was created by Alex Muensch (thank you, Alex!) and it was submitted just in time for the release of the new Hobbit movie based on the book by Tolkien. In The Hobbit, these cakes were made for Bilbo and the rest of the crew by the bear shapeshifter Beorn. The recipe is mostly a secret, except that everyone knows it contains honey like most of the foods Beornings eat. You know, cuz they're bears and bears eat honey... Anyway. Beornings are known throughout Middle-Earth for their wonderful baking skills, but especially for their honey-cakes, which are almost as filling as Lembas Bread. However, they are supposed to make you very thirsty. Alex's recipe is delicious and full of honey flavor and sweet enough to make you really want a drink; It would make any Beorning proud. I know I'm going to make this and bring it with me when I see The Hobbit! I suggest you do the same.
